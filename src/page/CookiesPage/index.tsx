				<h3>a. Essential/Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>

					These cookies are essential for our website to function correctly and
					cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in

					services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or
					filling in forms. Without these cookies, services you have asked for,
					like secure client portal access, cannot be provided.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Examples:</strong> Session cookies for login authentication,
					security cookies.
				</p>

				<h3>b. Analytics/Performance Cookies</h3>
				<p>
					These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can
					measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know
					which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move
					around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated
					and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will
					not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to
					monitor its performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Examples:</strong> Google Analytics cookies (e.g., `_ga`,
					`_gid`, `_gat`), which collect anonymized data on website usage.
				</p>

				<h3>c. Functionality Cookies</h3>

				<p>
					<strong>Examples:</strong> Cookies remembering your preferences (e.g.,
					language settings, form field pre-fills), chat support widgets.
				</p>

				<h3>d. Targeting/Advertising Cookies (if applicable)</h3>
				<p>
					These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners.
					They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your
					interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not
					store directly personal information but are based on uniquely
					identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow
					these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Examples:</strong> Cookies from social media platforms (e.g.,
					Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag), remarketing cookies (e.g.,
					Google Ads).

					services and may not extensively use targeting/advertising cookies.
